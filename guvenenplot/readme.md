# Guvenen-type plot readme, figure 4 first version of paper

The guvenen-type plots in the paper (v2) are:

- d19_femaleten_dptile_wgt.pdf

- d19_maleten_dptile_wgt.pdf

These are produced in "ludos regressions.do" (bit of a misnomer then). This do-file starts with the comments:
"run this with all variables known at around line 178 of qtregs_interactions_diff.do"
