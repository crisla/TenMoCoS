By 
Cristina Lafuente (clafuentemar@gmail.com), Astrid Ruland (astrid.ruland@eui.eu),

How to use the repo
* * * * * * * * * * *
- The data files can be downloaded from https://www.ine.es/uc/pNpBaUUm --
  inside the folder formatting there are detailes instructions on how to download and format the data.
  For size reasons, the data is not in the repo itself, but it is free and accesible to everyone.
- Once the data is clean, qtregs.do runs the quantile regressions in stata.
- Several jupyter notebooks read the output of these regressions and create plots, tables and stats.

That is pretty much it for now. When in doubt, email Cristina.
